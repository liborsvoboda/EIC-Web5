/**
 * Create a DataFormsJS Plugin that Generates and Saves an API Key on first use.
 *
 * The key will be saved to the user's local storage and submitted
 * with JSON Requests in the header ['Authorization' => 'Bearer {key}'].
 *
 * IMPORTANT - Storing Security Tokens in `localStorage` can be a security
 * risk for Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks so careful consideration
 * should be made in regards to storing tokens in a large public facing app.
 *
 * In general a "safe" alternative would be to store tokens in HttpOnly cookies,
 * however CSRF security concerns need to be taken into account when using HttpOnly cookies.
 * For this app the web service would have to be setup to use cookies, however currently
 * it uses the standard Authorization Header with a Bearer token.
 *
 * Another "safe" alternative for working with cookies would be using the [SameSite] Attribute
 * on the cookie from the server. That would not work in this case though because the
 * API is made available to any site including localhost.
 *
 * Additionally Content Security Policy (CSP) can be used from the server to make sure
 * that third-party scripts cannot access the DOM.
 *
 * This app uses only temporary demo data with known JavaScript files so security
 * is not a concern for this demo. The demo database on the server is a SQLite
 * database in the system tmp directory. On server reboots it gets cleared
 * and logic is in place to clear the file if it gets too large.
 *
 * Even though security is not a priority for this demo, this app is secure
 * because transport of the Bearer Token occurs over HTTPS, there are no
 * unknown third-party scripts that could steal the token, and the token
 * is generated on the server from cryptographically secure pseudo-random bytes.

I have released intercooler v1.2.3, available on the main site, as well as through bower and NPM.

  <http://intercoolerjs.org/download.html>

Changes in this release are:

* `ic-trigger-on` now supports multiple event names, separated by commas
* The `ic-sse-with-credentials` attribute enables SSE requests to be made with credentials
* The `ic-push-params` attribute allows you to include parameter values in the pushed URL
* Bug fixes 

Enjoy, and thanks for using intercooler!

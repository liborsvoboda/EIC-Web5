I have released intercooler v1.2.1, available on the main site, as well as through bower and NPM.

  <http://intercoolerjs.org/download.html>


Changes in this release are:

* Added the <code>once</code> modifier to the <code><a href="/attributes/ic-trigger-on.html">ic-trigger-on</a></code>
  attribute, to allow an event to trigger one and only one request.
* Added the <code><a href="/attributes/ic-transform-response.html">ic-transform-response</a></code> attribute to
  allow transforming JSON responses from a server into HTML on the client side.

* Fixed a bug that prevented <code><a href="/attributes/ic-on-beforeTrigger.html">ic-on-beforeTrigger</a></code> from
  working properly
  
Enjoy, and thanks for using intercooler!

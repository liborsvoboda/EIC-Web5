## hyperscript 0.9.12 Release

We are pleased to present the [0.9.12 release](https://unpkg.com/browse/hyperscript.org@0.9.12/) of hyperscript.

### Changes

* The [take](https://hyperscript.org/commands/take) take command can now take multiple classes at once
* Typescript bindings are now generated
* The go command scroll offset has been re-implemented and now works correctly
* The `message` symbol is properly set in web socket extension
* hex escapes now work properly in strings
* `_hyperscript` now includes a `version` property to easily see what version you are on from the console

Enjoy!

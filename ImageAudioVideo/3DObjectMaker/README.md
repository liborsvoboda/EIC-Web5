# 3D Object Maker

3D Object Maker compatible with models in STL, OBJ and 3DS format. You can export your work ready to print in 3D (STL format) or to keep working on it later (SCENE format).

## App version

## HOW TO USE THIS SOFTWARE

Add geometric shapes (from the right panel) to the plataform to create your own object. Also you can import STL, OBJ and 3DS models to the plataform. Later, export the object as STL file (for 3D printing) or as a SCENE file (to keep working on it later).

## HOW TO CUT OBJECTS

1) Add object A to the plaform.
2) Add object B to the platform.
3) Select object B.
4) Select the material 'Hollow' (from the right panel).
5) Export the work as a STL file (the object B will erase every object, partially or entirely, that is within it's space). Depending of how complex are the objects, the device may take a few minutes to perform the task.

## HOW TO FUSION OBJECTS

1) Add object A to the plaform.
2) Add object B to the platform.
3) Select object B.
4) Select any material (except 'Hollow') from the right panel.

## HOW TO MOVE AROUND THE PLATFORM

- In the App: One finger to rotate, two fingers to zoom in and out and three fingers to move the camera.

- In the Web: With your mouse, hold left-click and move the mouse to rotate, use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out and hold the right-click and move the mouse to move the camera.

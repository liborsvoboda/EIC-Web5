Playground
==========

This is an interactive HTML/CSS/JS playground similar to jsFiddle, jsBin, CodePen and the likes but much simpler with only the basic features.

This project is based on the wonderful work and [write-up](http://codetheory.in/building-your-own-html-css-js-realtime-playground/) of the CSSDeck Author, [Rishabh](http://codetheory.in/about/). You can see the [CSSDeck](http://cssdeck.com/) variant [here](http://cssdeck.com/labs/zcqps6a7). I couldn't find an example on Github so I created one.

To use it, clone or download and unzip the project and start a local webserver (like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`).

# JSPlayground.dev

A no-fuss JavaScript playground with instant feedback.

## Goal

It was created with the goal to provide a simple, fast and elegant playground for quickly prototyping JavaScript (and other web technologies) with instant feedback â€” without relying on any server dynamism.

## New features

Any feature request is open to consideration, as long as it does not require more than what a static web server can offer.
